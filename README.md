# Predicting-movie-genres-from-movie-plot-summary

As the name suggests, this project is to predict genre(s) of a movie based upon the movie plot. It is a multi-label classification problem as one movie may belong to more than one movie genre.

Presently, the code uploaded includes the data pre-processing part and code related to the neural network implementation to get the prediction work done. The coding part is not done and I am working on it.
